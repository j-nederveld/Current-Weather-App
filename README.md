# Current-Weather-App

utilize openweateher API to get current weather data

Users are able to search using a city name or zipcode in order to receive current weather data as well as a 5 day forecast.

In order to accomplish this, I have used a mix of API calls for the weather data and moment.js for displaying the dates for the 5 day forecast. 

Search history is logged and added to the top nav bar so that users may quickly recheck previously searched cities (if a user searches using zipcode, the city associated with that zipcode is logged for uniformity)

Upon opening the page, the last searched city's weather data will be displayed on the page.
